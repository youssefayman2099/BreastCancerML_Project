for this project I installed a specific add on which was 'Statistics and Machine learning Toolbox', version 23.2.
other add-ons where already there when matlab was downloaded which include MATLAB coder, MATLAB compiler, MATLAB compiler SDK, MATLAB Report Generator, and MATLAB test.

the test set is already defined in the main script file because the data was split into training and testing so there will be no need to download a test set online. the dataset is included in the file shown as "breast-cancer-data.csv"
